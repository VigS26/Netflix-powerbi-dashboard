ðŸ“¢ Key Insights

Netflix has more movies than TV shows, but series are growing rapidly.

2017â€“2020 saw the highest surge in new content.

The most common rating is TV-MA (mature audience).

Latvian-language titles are present but form a small niche segment.

The U.S., India, and the U.K. dominate Netflixâ€™s catalog.

ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements

Add trend forecasting for new releases.

Analyze viewership data (if available).

Compare Netflixâ€™s catalog with competitors (Disney+, Prime Video).
